# **eCommerce Customer Data Analysis**

## **Project Overview**

This project analyzes an eCommerce customer dataset to understand customer behavior, spending patterns, and factors affecting returns. The workflow includes **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, statistical hypothesis testing, and multiple linear regression modeling**. The insights are aimed at helping the business optimize marketing, membership strategies, and customer retention.

## **Assignment Objectives**

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

   * Check for missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data
   * Perform data type conversions
   * Encode categorical variables for analysis

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Compute descriptive statistics for numerical columns
   * Univariate analysis: histograms, box plots, bar charts
   * Bivariate analysis: correlation matrices, heatmaps, cross-tabulations, and comparative box plots

3. **Statistical Hypothesis Testing**

   * Test the relationship between Gender and Returned
   * Compare AmountSpent between Male and Female customers
   * Analyze differences in AmountSpent across Membership levels
   * Clearly state null and alternative hypotheses, p-values, assumptions, and interpretations

4. **Multiple Linear Regression Analysis**

   * Predict AmountSpent using Age, AnnualIncome, ItemsPurchased, Membership, Gender, etc.
   * Include regression coefficients, R-squared value, residual diagnostics, and model interpretation

5. **Final Report & Interpretation**

   * Summarize key findings
   * Provide actionable insights for business decision-making:

     * Customer spending behavior
     * Impact of membership and demographics on sales
     * Return behavior analysis
