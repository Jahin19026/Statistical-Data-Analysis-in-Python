# **eCommerce Customer Data Analysis**

## **Project Overview**

This project analyzes an eCommerce customer dataset to understand customer behavior, spending patterns, and factors affecting returns. The workflow includes **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, statistical hypothesis testing, and multiple linear regression modeling**. The insights are aimed at helping the business optimize marketing, membership strategies, and customer retention.

## **Assignment Objectives**

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

   * Check for missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data
   * Perform data type conversions
   * Encode categorical variables for analysis

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Compute descriptive statistics for numerical columns
   * Univariate analysis: histograms, box plots, bar charts
   * Bivariate analysis: correlation matrices, heatmaps, cross-tabulations, and comparative box plots

3. **Statistical Hypothesis Testing**

   * Test the relationship between Gender and Returned
   * Compare AmountSpent between Male and Female customers
   * Analyze differences in AmountSpent across Membership levels
   * Clearly state null and alternative hypotheses, p-values, assumptions, and interpretations

4. **Multiple Linear Regression Analysis**

   * Predict AmountSpent using Age, AnnualIncome, ItemsPurchased, Membership, Gender, etc.
   * Include regression coefficients, R-squared value, residual diagnostics, and model interpretation

5. **Final Report & Interpretation**

   * Summarize key findings
   * Provide actionable insights for business decision-making:

     * Customer spending behavior
     * Impact of membership and demographics on sales
     * Return behavior analysis

## **Usage Instructions**

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed
2. Install required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy statsmodels
```

3. Place the dataset `ecommerce_data.csv` in the project directory
4. Run the Python scripts sequentially to perform analysis and generate plots
5. Review the results, statistical tests, and regression outputs for interpretation

* Visualizations (histograms, box plots, bar charts, correlation heatmaps)
* Statistical test results and interpretation
* Regression model summary and residual analysis
* Final report with actionable business insights

If you want, I can also **make a shorter “GitHub-ready” version** that’s concise but still professional, suitable for your repository. Do you want me to do that?
